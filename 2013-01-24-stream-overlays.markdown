A few days ago we made two different stream overlays for our Starcraft team.

Made a pretty simple design in Photshop. Starcraft member Ajukrejzi helpt me out with the design and how he wanted the design to look. Took a few days to get everything done.Perhaps some change will be done further along the way. But the design in this post is the ones we use at the moment.

Follow our Starcraft2-team at: [sc2.darkstar.se](http://sc2.darkstar.se). There you can also see their streams and news.
