#### **The StarCraft II Team**


A few days ago, a Starcraft II team wanted to join the darkstar community. You can visit their site by entering the address [http://sc2.darkstar.se/Â ](http://sc2.darkstar.se)

The designer for their site is [synden](http://synden.darkdev.se/) with his [awesome skills.](http://blog.darkdev.se/vfx-shot-hill-explosion/)


#### **Darkstar - The Game**


The people here at darkstar always have some projects going on, and the latest and most fun is our game. We're going to create a MMORTS game that you play via your web browser. We are now going to explain the basic of the game setup, but have a little indulgence that things can be changed from time to time.
The goal with the game is just to learn, learn and learn. The best way to learn something is to do it with fun and who doesn't like games?


#### **Information about the game and the game play**


There is nothing special about it, you create an account, choose your tribe and your planet will automatically be created with some basic features. Then you need too build different building to achieve your own goals which can be to eliminate your neighbor but more information about this in a later post.

Some of the features the game will provide is that you can choose from 2-3 different tribes (not decided) there will also be a tribe that is not playable by people, the later tribe is controlled by the computer and it will work like a normal account, it will build things, train troops and attack normal players. The thing it will not do is to expand, in other words create new planets. It's a very powerful tribe so it's nothing you attack in the early stage of the game and neither will he, he actually has honor and a little sympathy.

We are now going to represent some of the feature of the game, we will start with the "[Colonel System](http://blog.darkdev.se/colonel-system/)", "Buildings and resources" and "Tribes".
