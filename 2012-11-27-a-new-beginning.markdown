It's all about the new beginning and it all have to start somewhere.
In the beginning we're talking about the development of a lot of different things.

On this blog we will write about the development of all our projects, we will try to write it so everyone can understand the progress and all the problems we will encounter.

We will also try to cover as much as possible within our subjects, as we learn them. The different programming languages are PHP, C/C++, Python, Scheme (only if it's an request), Django, HTML5 and CSS3. The image rendering programs we will try to cover are Photoshop, 3D studio max, Maya, and the video programs Adobe After Effects and Nuke.
