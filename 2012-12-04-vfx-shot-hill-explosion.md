For the last past months I've been trying to learn NukeX instead of After Effects. I've been using After Effects for the last 3-4 years. But lately I found how awesome NukeX is. So now I spend my time to become better at Nuke.

Here is a short post about the latest VFX shot I've been playing around with. It's an explosion I integrated with footage from "Project Arbiter".

Below you can see some pictures from the shot.

Final render with color grading.




This shot took me around 4-5hrs to make. I had a real problem with the grass.
Both with to make it lookÂ integrated in the shot and also the matte. First I did a regular 2D track,
but it didn't work as well as I hoped. Then I did a 3D track. Now it's just the audio
and make the final touches on the color grading.




Post with the video will come up this week.
