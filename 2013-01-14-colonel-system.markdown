Earlier we talked about [Darkstar - The Game](http://blog.darkdev.se/new-sites-to-our-community/) and we presented some of the features. In this post we will talk about the Colonel system and how it works.

We havenâ€™t decided yet if the players will start with an Colonel or if they have to train him from another unit. The plus side if the player will start with him, all the Colonels will have the same skills at level zero. We haven't yet done a proper algorithm for the experience needed to level up. As soon it's done we will update this post with all numbers.


#### **Colonel Skills**


A Colonel will gain two or three points per level that you can distribute between the following skills:



	
  * Strength

	
  * Offensive Bonus

	
  * Defensive Bonus


Now let's explain the different types of skills


#### Strength


How strong the Colonel will be, let's say it have 10.000 in fighting strength, and you attack an army with an total of 5.000 defensive strength and your Colonel have 100% health before the attack, it will kill all the enemy troops and return with 50% health points. Logic we know but in more complex situation it can be hard to predict the results and for these situations, we will create a combat simulator also.


#### Offensive Bonus


All troops attacking with the Colonel will get this bonus, let's say you have 3% offensive bonus and you attack with a total of 4 troops with 50 offensive strength each, the total offensive strength will be 206 with the above example. This bonus will _not_ apply to the Colonels strength.


#### Defensive Bonus


It's works the same as Offensive Bonus but for the defending units, one thing though is that this bonus only applies to the player troops. So you can't reinforce a planet with different Colonels and get the bonus from all of them, pretty self-explained but anyway.


#### **Colonel in the different tribes**


This section will be updated when we have chosen the different tribes and what benefits you get from each and one of them.
